###Course description##

In this seven-week introduction to data journalism, you'll be exposed to the history of the craft of numerate reporting.
You'll develop and finetune your bullshit detector for bad data reporting and writing. You'll be introduced to modern data practices, including software for examining spreadsheets, databases, PDFs and other common forms of data.
You'll also become comfortable with the basic steps of an analysis that you can integrate into your reporting.

###Requirements
I work in a newsroom. I assume that you hope to do the same as quickly after graduation as possible. I'm going to treat you as I would any of my newsroom colleagues. I'll expect you to show up on time, do your homework, pay attention and ask questions. You can expect the same from me.
When you hear something that doesn't sound right, or if something doesn't make sense or is unclear, which is entirely possible given the subject matter, ask me about it.

In addition to doing the assigned readings and participating in the weekly class discussions and exercises, you will be required to report and write two data memos. We'll discuss those in our first couple of classes.
