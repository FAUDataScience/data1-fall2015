#Outline of a data memo

##Introduction

A quick lede graf covering the provenance of the data and the big takeaway (or nut) of your initial analysis. The rest of these sections can be one graf intros followed by bullet points. The idea is to give editors and colleagues who are not necessarily data savvy an honest sense of the possibilities of the data as well as its shortcomings. Be clear about what the story is you're pursuing that this data can help with. This isn't just an academic exercise. What is the nut graf of the story? This can help lay out a realistic plan and timeline for working with the data and reporting out a story.

##Summary of what we have

* How many records are in this data?
* What format is it in?
* What is the universe covered by this data? Is this a database of criminal justice policies in all state universities in the country, or just the ones that responded to a survey? Make clear what is being capture here.
* Be sure to include descriptive statistics. Be sure to include sums, averages, medians and ranges of values in key columns to give a little context. 

##Caveats

* What's not in the data that you (or an editor) might expect?
* What problems do you notice with various columns? Do some living people have birthdates in the 1800s? Do some columns contradict one another?
* What gives you pause?

##What we can say

Given all the pitfalls you already laid out, explain briefly here what is possible to say given the data in hand right now. Is there documentation with the data? Did you read it?

##Outstanding questions

There are two types of questions you can list here: questions you have about how to work with and interpret the data itself and reporting questions the data bring to mind to ask other sources. What other data sets can complement the analysis and reporting?

##The Reporting Plan

This should be a brief proposal for a reporting plan to pursue the ideal story that this data might lead to. What holes need to be filled? How much work will be involved in cleaning and analyzing the data fully? How long will that take? What other sources will you pursue? If you can't shoot the moon with this data, what fallback possibilities might it offer? Be sure to be clear about how much time and effort it will take to report this out.
